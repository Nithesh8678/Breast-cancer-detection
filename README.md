# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

Welcome to my first Machine Learning project! 🚀  
This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques, based on publicly available datasets. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on various medical attributes.

## 🧠 About The Project

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide.  
**Early detection plays a critical role** in treatment success.

In this project:

- I trained a machine learning model to classify tumors as **benign** (non-cancerous) or **malignant** (cancerous).
- Used the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**.
- Built and evaluated models using **supervised learning techniques**.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29)  
- **Features**: Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness, etc.  
- **Target**: Diagnosis (**M** = Malignant, **B** = Benign)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- Google Colab 📓  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** for machine learning models

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load and explore the dataset 📂  
2. Clean and preprocess the data 🧹  
3. Split the data into training and testing sets ✂️  
4. Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) 🎯  
5. Evaluate the models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report 📈  
6. Visualize important insights 📊

## 🚀 Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 🖥️ Usage
- Open the notebook in Google Colab.

- Run all cells step-by-step.

- You can upload your own breast cancer dataset if you'd like to try it on new data.

### 📈 Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 95%.

- Model performed well on test data.

- Visualized feature importance and confusion matrix for better insights.
